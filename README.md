# VisualPairCoding

A small Winforms app to visually display whos turn it is when coding together in a mob or in a pair.

## Features

- Up to 10 Participants
- The length of the session is customizable
- Skip current "Driver" if he/she is absent (went out of the room for a turn)
- Animation with the name of the next "Driver" when roles change, so a new turn cannot be easily overlooked
- visual, so that it does work with remote sessions

## Idea

When a PairCoding Session starts, there will be a "Driver" and a "Recommended Navigator". The "Driver" has to do the coding while being advised from the "Recommended Navigator" with coding tips. This way both the "Driver" and the "Recommended Navigator" benefit from the process and learn something new from each other.
